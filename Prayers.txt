Machine god whisper onto me the secrets of thy mechanism. 
Grant me wisdom so I may repair this machine to give it the spark of life. 
May it be filled with purpose to serve, Ave machina


I have a body.
This body is flawed.
It grows old, it gets sick, it pains me.
This body is mine.
But this body is not me.
And so I shall perfect this body.
I shall make it flawless.
I shall thrive in spite of age, of illness, of pain.
For this body is mine.
And I shall make this body me.
